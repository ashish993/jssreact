/**
 * Returns the default AppInvocationInfoResolver, which is responsible for resolving the function, within your app bundle,
 * that should be invoked for rendering your app.
 *
 * By default, the resolver assumes a folder structure of:
 * `./{baseAppPath}/{JSSAppName}/{serverBundleName}.js`
 *
 * `JSSAppName` is the `id` property of the JSON request body that is POSTed to the rendering host by Sitecore.
 *
 * `serverBundleName` is the name of the JavaScript file (typically a bundle) that contains the function for rendering your app.
 *
 * @param {string} [baseAppPath='./dist'] The base path to your JSS app(s), defaults to `./dist`
 * @returns {AppInvocationInfoResolver} resolver
